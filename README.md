# Hotel
Application for handling hotel services (reservations, additional services)

The application helps to manage hotel services:
+ adding a new guest to the database,
+ updating guest details,
+ deletion of guest data from the database
and
+ calculation of the booking cost (cost of the room and additional services),
+ canceling the reservation and sending an email to the guest with information about the reason for the cancellation.

At the beginning, there are a few simple functionalities that can be further developed or added new ones.
The application is written using Spring Boot.It uses Spring Data JPA repositories. It has different validation rules and two unit tests.
